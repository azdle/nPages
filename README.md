#nPages
##Description
This program is designed to open one or more stripped out browsers in fullscreen mode on systems with multiple monitors. It will then automatically refresh the page or cycle through a set of pages at a configurable interval.
##Status
The code is pretty much in a state of proof of concept right now. It will open two windows, one of our status page and one that cycles through several example dashboards.
##Program Information
This was written in C++ using the Qt library.
