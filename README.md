#nPages
##Description
This program is designed to open one or more simple browsers in fullscreen mode on systems with multiple monitors. It will then automatically refresh the page or cycle through a set of pages at a configurable interval. It is configurable using [Exosite Portals](https://portals.exosite.com).

##Status
This program was rewritten in python because I was tired of battling silly low level issues in the C++ version. It is actually a small step backwards in functionality, but since it's much easier to maintain now it will be gaining features much more quickly.

##Program Information
This is written in Python and uses the PyQt library.
