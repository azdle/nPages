#nPages
##Description
This program is designed to open one or more simple browsers in fullscreen mode on systems with multiple monitors. It will then automatically refresh the page or cycle through a set of pages at a configurable interval.
##Status
Right now this program will only get it's list of urls from an Exosite One Platform Datasource. I needed this feature so that others in my office could update the list of dashboards that gets displayed. I do plan to add manual setting at sometime in the future, but I don't know when that will be.
##Program Information
This was written in C++ using the Qt library.
